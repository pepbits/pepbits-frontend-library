# Demo apps

Applications that demonstrate and test the library. Phase 6a adds the independent showcase in the [library restructure plan](../docs/architecture/PACKAGE-RESTRUCTURE-PLAN.md).

- Each demo is `@pepbits-demo/<folder>` and `"private": true`. Demos are never published, and product repositories never use them.
- Demos import only the public exports of `@pepbits/*` packages from `packages/`, never another demo and never a `src/` path.
- Demo data is fictional. The showcase uses explicitly volatile in-memory adapters; later demos may use the mock API.

## Showcase

[Showcase](showcase/README.md) is the first standalone Next.js demo. Run `npm run dev -w @pepbits-demo/showcase` from the repository root (port 3300); build/start/typecheck/test scripts are in its guide. Eight routes cover foundations, primitives, components, patterns, page engines, policy, Shell and AI inside the full library workspace frame. The 55 source-backed examples include tabs/split/MDI, fictional detached windows, shell layers, preferences/login and browser-only AI simulation. AI starts off and is enabled in the policy playground; no provider or server endpoint is configured.

Remaining order: healthcare, erp, school, reports, tenant-admin, onboarding, settle, caregrid, allyvora-patients, desktop. Each is its own app and will be built one at a time.
